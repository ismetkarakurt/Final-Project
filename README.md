ABSTRACT

The purpose of this study is to design several heuristic solutions for the winner determination problem (WDP) that occurs 
in the market model proposed in this study. In this regard, this study proposes another approach for the secondary marketplaces 
that aims to reduce the time loss occurs in the item and money transaction procedures and attaches the barter logic. This model 
provides users to buy and sell at the same time without waiting for cash flow and matches the traders with each other 
automatically. Main objective is to maximize the total weight value of traded items. This weight value shows the importance of 
relevant request considering the price of requested item, user’s necessities and preferences. In general, this model aims to 
accelerate the trade of new and secondary goods and to maximize cash flow considering user’s necessities and preferences. While 
doing so, a heuristic algorithm works on the WDP that is formed from the instant dataset. This algorithm approximates to the best 
trade scenario considering these model features. In this context, different approaches have been implemented in the way of solvin 
the WDP and the results are observed. The evaluation of the success in this study is made by comparing the solutions found by this
study with the solutions found by optimization tool. In this process, the best success ratio encountered is the average 86.61 
percent in optimal values with a runtime of average 433 seconds in the used test cases. The fastest algorithm takes average 9.54 
seconds with a success ratio of average 80.49 percent again in the optimal values.
